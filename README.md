# Open User Creators Backend.
UPDATE: need to do a little side gig.

What next? Need to add an openuser app update function for the microservices. 

UPDATE: Done with the side gig, took me 12 days to finish.

What next? tidy up celery tasks and microservices connections (rabbitmq). And then write unit test for the openuserdata microservice.
